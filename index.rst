About sdaas
============
Sdaas, meaning silent disco as a service, makes setting up a an automated
silent disco easy. With sdaas, there's no need for expensive headphones or even
a dj! Sdaas automates selecting and merging music together based on real-time feedback
from the users to allow for a fantastic silent disco.

Due to sdaas' modular architecture, it's easy to expand on our software and add
new features or edit current features. This documentation will go over the three
main components of sdaas: the server, the controller and the app. Please note that this
documentation is both meant for users that just want to understand the basic working
of sdaas to set up a silent disco and for users that want to fully understand and
perhaps add new features.
